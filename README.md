# Graph_Display
The app simply displays different types of graphs using X and Y coordinates. The key feature of the app is that it gives you a zoomed-in view of the graph to read them better and also the user can save the graph as an image or a PDF. It demonstrates using external libraries through Gradle dependency, saving a file to phone storage, etc.
